      26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array Given an integer array nums sorted
      in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each
      unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements
      should be kept the same. Since it is impossible to change the length of
      the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in
      the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements
      after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should
      hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first
      k elements. Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots
      of nums. Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this
      by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory
