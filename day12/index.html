        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>
          The css position property tells/decide how an element should be
          positioned in a page.Given the different syntax which we can use like
          relative, absolute , fixed, static, static. it decide how a particular
          element behaves with respect to other.
          <p><u>A positioned element is an element whose computed position value is either relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky. (In other words, it's anything except static.)</u></p>
         </p>

        <p>
          With the help of which we can can position an element on
          top,bottom,left,right in a page itself.Like I did top:20px and
          right:5px.

         <h1>Float</h1>
         <p>We also have something called float.The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. <br>let an image float left to the text in a container.The float property can have one of the following values:<br>

            left - The element floats to the left of its container<br>
            right - The element floats to the right of its container<br>
            
            inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
            In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.</p>
